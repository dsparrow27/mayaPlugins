# mayaPlugins

General purpose repo for c++ maya dev

As i learn more of the maya APi and c++, ill be adding most if not all the code on here. 


Feel free to give feedback on code, gotta improve right? :)


Node IDs on the plugin(s) are from autodesk,  so plugin(s) shouldn't clash with others, if they do then contact the 
other developer.


@TODO

:Write some instructions for how to use the nodes etc. lol :P 
:iterate through most nodes to update the code.
